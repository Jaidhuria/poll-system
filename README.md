# 🗳️ Poll System - Frontend

A simple and interactive **Poll System** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can vote on a question with multiple options and see live vote results instantly. Designed as a frontend-only project to demonstrate UI/UX and logic implementation using vanilla web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- Vote on poll options
- Real-time result update (frontend logic)
- Responsive and user-friendly UI
- Customizable questions and options via code

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
  
 ## 🧠 How It Works

- The poll question and options are defined in the HTML or JavaScript.
- When a user selects an option and submits, the UI updates to reflect vote counts.
- All votes are stored in-memory (no backend).

> *Note: This is a frontend-only demo; votes will reset on page refresh.*

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add backend support to store real votes
- Prevent multiple votes from same user/device
- Poll creation interface
